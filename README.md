### Hi, I'm Bruce Hsu

I started getting involved in coding by writing VBA macros to automate tasks for my coworkers. It was really fulfilling, so I decided to take a plunge and learn how to code full-time, starting with web dev, to be able to write code at scale. I'm currently looking for a role in full-stack web development, ideally in Javascript/Typescript. I would love to work in a fast-paced environment where we can execute and bring products to users quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
