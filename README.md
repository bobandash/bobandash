### Hi, I'm Bruce Hsu

I began my coding journey by creating VBA macros to automate tasks for my colleagues. This experience motivated me to dive deeper into coding full-time to learn how to create scalable solutions. I am now proficient in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and a range of frameworks for these languages. I’m eager to work in a dynamic environment where we can rapidly build and implement solutions. Currently, I'm working on an MVP for a Shopify App and studying system design. If you’re looking for someone with my skills, let’s connect!
